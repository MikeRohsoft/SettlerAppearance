# BetterEnchantment

I think punishing the Player for playing the Game is generally a bad Idea.
However, I also wanted to stay close as possible on the initial Idea of the currect Enchantment System and don't want to overhaul everything.
So all I did is implementing a new currency (Enchantment Shards) which will be dropped by Monsters in dungeons and can be combined
to Enchantment Orb's, which can be used to enchant your Items like you are used to.

You can't see the reason why you can enchant your Items by another Settlement's NPC Mage, if your Settler left you?
Well, I don't either, so I also gave you an Enchantment Table. You don't need it tho, but you also don't need the Mage for that anymore either.

So with this Mod it's still the same bad punishing System as before, but at least no longer at the expense of the most important raw material, your precious coins.

# Known Issues:
- If you have more than 1 Table and you abuse 1 of them as Item Stand for an Item which can't be enchanted, you can't use any Enchantment Table anymore

# Credits
- Thanks to Dottellini for the amazing Sprites and his knowledge of the Game
